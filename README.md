# Mobile UX Mockup

This repository showcases a mobile-first UX design for an AI Portfolio application, created in **Figma**. It extends the visual identity of my portfolio website to mobile devices and includes space for AI chatbot modules, skills display, and project storytelling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To demonstrate thoughtful UX/UI skills integrated with AI product design sensibilities. The design reflects:
- A modern, minimalistic visual style
- Clear content hierarchy for AI skills and services
- Placeholder for AI chat assistant (RAG/LLM-ready)
- iOS-style native design with clean mobile transitions
